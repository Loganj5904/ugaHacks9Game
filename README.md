# Purpose
The purpose is to create a tower defense game that evolves as time continues on.

# Tools Utilized
Used VS Code | Pygame API

# Problems we ran into
We had another idea, yet realized that we didn't quite have the technical experience for this, so we had to put it on the backburner until we can finish it. With a few hours left, we had to return back to the drawing board and create a quick game that we can continue to evolve over time. We plan to change the app into a progressively changing game based on the player's current skill level, however with the little time, it is still a very early prototype.
